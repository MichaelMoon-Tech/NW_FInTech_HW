Stablecoins and the Luna Token

Terraform Labs

Founded: 2018 in Seoul, South Korea

Founder - Do Kwon


The idea for the project began with the concept of decentralized money. According to the original Medium post, the idea was to create a decentralized form of currency that has a superior "value store and value transfer" to that of fiat and other stablecoins. 

Terraform Labs is privately funded. According to CrunchBase, there are seven lead investors with a total of 26 investors. Fifteen funding rounds with a total of $58 million.


Business Activities:



Terraform Labs is attempting to deliver multiple superior decentralized stable coins that are algorithmically pegged to the Luna token. One of the main focuses of Terraform Labs is usability. The team has created the first real world use of stablecoins backed by a stable platform.The intended customer is anyone that has the ability to transact with crypto stablecoins. The Chai Payment Card in South Korea utilizes stablecoins via their dAPP and allow users to transact with merchants using their respective stable coins (mainly KRW). According to ChaiScan there are currently 2.39 million registered users with over 113,000 daily transactions. The unfair advantage utilized by Do Kwon and team is their understanding of efficient adoption while initializing "programmatic distribution of seigniorage" back to the users. By rewarding the users this increases adoption due to the enticing staking rewards. Do Kown understands that the price of Luna craves actual use demand for stable coins. With this understanding in mind, Terraform Labs introduced a few projects that also utilize stablecoins, such as Anchor Protocol (Lending) and Mirror Protocol (Synthetic Assets). Terraform Labs currently uses 49 active technologies while 27 have been removed. A few of the current technologies include Google Analytics, Amazon, and Apple. Google analytics is used to track daily/weekly/monthly traffic throughout the platform. Amazon is used as a hosting site. iPhone / Mobile compatible technology is provided by Apple, which create mobile applications.


Landscape:



Terraform Labs falls under the cryptocurrency FinTech domain. However, on a deeper level it actually offers solutions from all the respected domains. Being able to tap into multiple use case scenarios is a unique advantage for Terraform Labs. For example the Anchor Protocol is Lending, Alice Finance will be personal finance and Mirror Protocol is investment management. All of the listed protocols utilize stable coins pegged to the Luna token, increasing demand. The major trends and innovations within blockchain and cryptocurrency are decentralized finance and non fungible tokens. Decentralized finance has piggybacked off of mobile and online banking. By cutting out the middle man, fees to transact are significantly lower with cryptocurrency. Also the ability for any user to partake in distributed seigniorage is unheard of in traditional finance. The competitors within this domain are Tether also known as USDT and the USD Coin or USDC. Tether is a stable coin that is pegged 1tether-$1 to the dollar. USD Coin is also backed by assets pegged to the dollar. These differ from Terraform Labs, which uses algorithms to peg luna token to the stable coins.


Results:


The results have been promising for the project. Having launched in 2018 and sneaking onto exchanges such as KuCoin, Terraform Labs has since launched Mirror Protocol and Anchor Protocol. According to CoinGecko, Luna token has a market cap above $7 billion and UST stable coin has market cap of $2 billion. This is one of the few companies to have a real world functioning stable coin that is being utilized in South Korea via the Chai Payment Card. One of the metrics that is used by investors is market cap. Based on market cap Terraform Labs is currently sitting in the top 25 cryptocurrency projects. With Luna it is also important to total transactions and fees, these are indicators of growth. Terraform Labs is performing extremely well since 2018. Terraform Labs really took a leap up on its competitors in 2021. With the launch of Mirror Protocol, Anchor Protocol and more daily Chai users the demand for UST increased. As stated in the white paper growth in the beginning is key for Luna while maintaining demand is the goal. 



Recommendations:


I would like to see the implementation of non fungible tokens integrated into the terraform labs platforms. I think NFT's have an abundance use case including contracts and digital art. I imagine purchasing real estate via stable coins and being able to use NFT as legally binding contracts. The amount of fees saved would be astronomical. This would also create a new avenue for demand. If the rumors are true regarding Alice Finance this would have been my recommendation for a mobile banking platform. A decentralized mobile personal finance api.
